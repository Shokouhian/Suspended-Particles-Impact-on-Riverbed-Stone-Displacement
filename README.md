# Project Description

## Introduction
This project focuses on investigating the impact of suspended particles in water on the displacement of riverbed stones. The study aims to enhance our understanding of hydraulic processes and the changes occurring in the morphology of riverbeds.

## Methodology
The project employs a combination of field studies and laboratory experiments to gather data and analyze the relationship between suspended particles and stone displacement.

### Field Studies
During the field studies, data is collected from real rivers to observe and measure various parameters over time. The following measurements and observations are conducted:
- Water flow rate measurements to understand the flow dynamics.
- Monitoring and measuring the concentration of suspended particles in the water.
- Documenting changes in the positions and displacement of riverbed stones.

### Laboratory Experiments
In the laboratory, controlled experiments are conducted using artificial components and mathematical simulations. The experiments involve:
- Constructing mathematical models to simulate water flow and its interaction with suspended particles.
- Observing and measuring the impact of suspended particles on the displacement of stones in a controlled environment.

## Equipment and Tools
To execute this project, the following equipment and tools are utilized:
- Water flow sensors to measure the rate of flow in rivers.
- Suspended particle sensors to quantify the concentration of particles in the water.
- Data logging devices to record and analyze the collected data.
- Laboratory equipment for conducting controlled experiments and simulations.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the relationship between suspended particles in water and the displacement of riverbed stones. By combining field studies and laboratory experiments, it seeks to contribute to our understanding of hydraulic processes and riverbed morphology changes. The findings and observations from this project can be used to improve river management strategies and enhance our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of suspended particles on river ecosystems.
